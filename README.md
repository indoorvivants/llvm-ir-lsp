# LLMV IR LSP

<sup>just look at this poor defenceless I surrounded by consonants</sup>

This is an experimental [Language Server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) to work with [LLVM IR](https://www.llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html) - the `.ll` files produced by compiler frontends.

Currently it focuses on the metadata section, but the intent is to expand support to everything that the IR supports and makes sense in the context of IDE experience.

Here's a GIF so you know it's solid.
